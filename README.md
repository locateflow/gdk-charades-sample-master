Charades
========

This sample implements a simple Charades game using immersions. When started,
the game first displays a splash screen from which the user can start a new
game or view the instructions.

Once the game itself begins, ten phrases are randomly selected and one is
displayed to the wearer. He or she is expected to act out the phrase, and then
**tap** if the other players correctly guess the phrase or **swipe forward**
to pass on that phrase and come back to it later (time permitting).

When all the phrases are guessed correctly or time has run out, a
`CardScrollView` will appear that displays the results of the game. The
wearer can now tap to open a menu containing a "New game" option, or swipe
down to leave the game.
